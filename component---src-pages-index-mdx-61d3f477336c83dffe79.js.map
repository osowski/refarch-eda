It learns, predicts and is intelligent — it is by nature Event Driven.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Event-driven architecture (EDA) is an architecture pattern that promotes the production, detection, consumption of, and reaction to events. This architectural pattern can be applied to the systems that transmit events among loosely coupled software components and services. `}</p>\n    <p>{`The business value is that you can easily extend EDA with new components that are ready to produce or consume events that already are in place in the overall system. While events are more visible, new business capabilities are addressed, like applying insight in real time when events occur. EDA helps also to improve continous availability of microservice architecture.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`Events are a way of capturing a statement of fact.  Events occur in a continuous stream as things happen in the real and digital worlds.  By taking advntage of this continous stream, applications can not only react in real time, but also reason about the future based upon what has happened in the past.`}</p>\n    <p>{`For enterprise IT teams, embracing event driven development is foundational to the next generation of digital business applications.
