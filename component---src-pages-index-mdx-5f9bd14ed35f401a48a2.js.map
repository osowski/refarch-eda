This architectural pattern can be applied to the systems that transmit events among loosely coupled software components and services.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The business value is that you can easily extend EDA with new components that are ready to produce or consume events that already are in place in the overall system.

Specialized *streaming analytics engines* provide the means to run stateful analytical and complex event processing workloads across multiple real time event streams while maintaining low latency processing times.\n      Including these engines as part of the Event Driven Architecture enables:\n      * Analysis and understanding of real time event streams\n      * Extracting real time event data from the stream so that Data Scientists can understand and derive Machine Learning models\n      * Running analytical processes, Machine Learning models in line in real time against the event stream.\n      * Matching of complex event patterns across multiple streams and time windows to make decisions and take actions\n      [Read more ...](./rt-analytics/README/)\n      ## Event Driven Cloud Native Apps (Microservices)\n      The event driven architecture must also reach across into our application platform. Developers will build applications which interact with events and are themselves event driven, that is they will both produce and consume events via the event backbone.\n      In this context we can view the Event Backbone as being part of the microservices mesh, providing the Pub/Sub communication between microservices, and therefore enabling the support of loosely coupled event driven microservices.\n      [Read more ...](./evt-microservices/README/)\n      */\n    }\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
