As businesses become event-driven, event driven pattern needs to extend into our microservices application space. This means that your microservices are still doing REST calls to well-known microservice but they must respond to and send out events, or in event-driven terms they need to be both event producers and consumers to enforce strong decoupling.\n\n### Event backbone - Pub/Sub communication and data sharing for microservices\n\n![](evt-micro.png)\n\nWith the adoption of microservices, the focus on synchronous communication between services has increased. Service mesh packages such as [Istio](https://istio.io/) help with the management of communication, service discovery, load balancing, and visibility in this synchronous communication environment.\n\nWith event-driven microservices, the communication point becomes the Pub/Sub layer of the event backbone. By adopting an event-based approach for intercommunication between microservices, the microservices applications are naturally responsive (event-driven). This approach enhances the loose coupling nature of microservices because it decouples producers and consumers.  Further, it enables the sharing of data across microservices through the event log.\nThese *event* style characteristics are increasingly important considerations when you develop microservices style applications. In practical terms microservices applications are a combination of synchronous API-driven, and asynchronous event-driven communication styles.
