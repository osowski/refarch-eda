We are documenting how to deploy Kafka on IBM Cloud Private or deploying [IBM Event Streams product](https://developer.ibm.com/messaging/event-streams). This content does not replace [the excellent introduction](https://Kafka.apache.org/intro) every developer using Kafka should read.\n\n\n## Introduction\n\n[Kafka](https://Kafka.apache.org) is a distributed real time event streaming platform with the following key capabilities:\n\n* Publish and subscribe streams of records. Data are stored so consuming applications can pull the information they need, and keep track of what they have seen so far.\n* It can handle hundreds of read and write operations per second from many producers and consumers\n* Atomic broadcast, send a record once, every subscriber gets it once.\n* Store streams of data records on disk and replicate within the distributed cluster for fault-tolerance. Persist data for a given time period before delete.\n* Can grow elastically and transparently with no downtime.\n* Built on top of the ZooKeeper synchronization service to keep topic, partitions and metadata highly available.\n\n### Use cases\n\nThe typical use cases where **Kafka** helps are:\n\n* Centralize online data pipeline to decouple applications and microservices.\n* Pub/sub messaging for cloud native application inter microservices.\n* Aggregation of event coming from multiple producers.\n* Monitor distributed applications to produce centralized feed of operational data.\n* Logs collector from multiple services.\n* Implement [event soucing pattern](../design-patterns/event-sourcing/) out of the box, using configuration to keep message for a long time period. Data are replicated between brokers within the cluster and cross availability zones if needed. \n* Manage loosely coupled communication between microservices. (See [this note](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-integration/service-mesh/readme/#asynchronous-loosely-coupled-solution-using-events) where we present a way to support a service mesh solution using asynchronous event)\n\n## Key concepts\n\nThe diagram below presents Kafka's key components:  \n\n ![](images/kafka-hl-view.png)\n\n### Brokers\n\n* **Kafka** runs as a cluster of one or more **broker** servers that can, in theory, span multiple data centers. It is really possible if the network latency between data centers is very low, at the 10ms or better, as there are a lot of communication between kafka brokers and between kafka and zookeepers. So the advice is to avoid cross data centers deployment.  \n* The **Kafka** cluster stores streams of records in **topics**. Topic is referenced by producer to send data to, and subscribed by consumers to get data. Data in topic is persisted to file systems for a retention time period (Defined at the topic level). The file system can be network based. \n\nIn the figure above, the **Kafka** brokers are allocated on three servers, with data within the topic are replicated two times. In production, it is recommended to use at least five nodes to authorise planned failure and un-planned failure, and when doing replicas, use a replica factor equals to the number of brokers.\n\n### Topics \n\nTopics represent end points to put or get records to.\n\n* Each record consists of a key, a value (the data payload as byte array), and a timestamp.\n* Producers publish data records to topic and consumers subscribe to topics. When a record is produced without specifying a partition, a partition will be chosen using a hash of the key. If the record did not provide a timestamp, the producer will stamp the record with its current time (creation time or log append time). Producers hold a pool of buffers to keep records not yet transmitted to the server.\n* Kafka store log data in its `log.dir` and topic maps to subdirectories in this log directory.\n* **Kafka** uses topics with a pub/sub combined with queue model: it uses the concept of consumer group to divide the processing over a collection of consumer processes, running in parallel, and messages can be broadcasted to multiple groups.\n* Consumer performs asynchronous pull to the connected brokers via the subscription to a topic.\n\nThe figure below illustrates one topic having multiple partitions, replicated within the broker cluster:  \n![](./images/kafka-topic-partition.png)  \n\n### Partitions\n\nPartitions are basically used to parallelize the event processing when a single server would not be able to process all events, using the broker clustering. So to manage increase in the load of messages, Kafka uses partitions.\n\n![](images/topic-part-offset.png)   \n\n* Each broker may have zero or more partitions per topic. When creating topic we specify the number of partition to use. \n* Kafka tolerates up to N-1 server failure without losing any messages. N is the replication factor for a given partition. \n* Each partition is a time ordered immutable sequence of records, that are persisted for a long time period. It is a log. Topic is a labelled log.\n* Consumers see messages in the order they are stored in the log.\n* Each partition is replicated across a configurable number of servers for fault tolerance. The number of partition will depend on characteristics like the number of consumers, the traffic pattern, etc... You can have 2000 partitions per broker.\n* Each partitioned message has a unique sequence id called **offset** (\"abcde, ab, a ...\" in the figure above are offsets). Those offset ids are defined when events arrived at the broker level, and are local to the partition. They are inmutable. \n* When a consumer reads a topic, it actually reads data from all the partitions. As a consumer reads data from a partition, it advances its offset. To read an event the consumer needs to use the topic name, the partition number and the last offset to read from. \n* Brokers keep offset information in an hidden topic.\n* Partitions guarantee that data with the same keys will be sent to the same consumer and in order.\n\n\n### Replication\n\nEach partition can be replicated accross a number of server. The replication factor is capted by the number of brokers. Partitions have one leader and zero or more followers. The leader manages all the read and write requests for the partition. Leader is also responsible to track the \"in sync\" replicas. The followers replicate the leader content. \n\nIf a leader fails, followers elect a new one. When a producer sends message, it can control how to get the response from the committed message: wait for all replicas to succeed, wait for one acknowledge, fire and forget. Consumers receive only committed messages. \n\n### Zookeeper\n\nZookeeper is used to persist the component and platform states and it runs in cluster to ensure high availability. One zookeeper server is the leader and other are used in backup. \n\n* Kafka does not keep state regarding consumers and producers.\n* Depends on kafka version, offsets are maintained in Zookeeper or in **Kafka**: newer versions use an internal Kafka topic called __consumer_offsets. In any case consumers can read next message (or from a specific offset) correctly even during broker server outrages. \n* Access Controls are saved in Zookeeper\n\n### Consumer group\n\nThis is the way to group consumers so the processing of event is parallelized. The number of consumers in a group is the same as the number of partition defined in a topic. We are detailing consumer group implementation in [this note](./consumers/)\n\n\n## Architecture\n\nSee [this separate note](arch/) addresses high availability and kubernetes deployment.\n\n\n## Solution considerations\n\nThere are a set of design considerations to assess for each **Kafka** solution:\n\n### Topics\n\nPerformance is more a function of number of partitions than topics. Expect that each topic has at least one partition. When considering latency you should aim for limiting to hundreds of topic-partition per broker node.\n\nWhat of the most important question is what topics to use?. What is an event type? Should we use one topic to support multiple event types? \nLet define that an event type is linked to a main business entity like an Order, a ship, a FridgeredContainer. OrderCreated, OrderCancelled, OrderUpdated, OrderClosed are events linked to the states of the Order. The order of those events matter. So the natural approach is to use one topic per data type or schema, specially when using the topic as Event Sourcing where event order is important to build the audit log. You will use a unique partition to support that. The orderID is the partition key and all events related to the order are in the same topic.\n\nThe important requirement to consider is the sequencing or event order. When event order is very important then use a unique partition, and use the entity unique identifier as key. Ordering is not preserved across partitions.\n\nWhen dealing with entity, independent entities may be in separate topics, when strongly related one may stay together.\n\nOther best practices:\n\n* When event order is important use the same topic and use the entity unique identifier as partition key.\n* When two entities are related together by containment relationship then they can be in the same topic. \n* Different entities are separated to different topics.\n* It is possible to group topics in coarse grained one when we discover that several consumers are listening to the same topics. \n* Clearly define the partition key as it could be an compound key based on multiple entities.\n\nWith **Kafka** stream, state store or KTable, you should separate the changelog topic from the others.\n\n### Producers\n\nWhen developing a record producer you need to assess the following:\n\n* What is the expected throughput to send events? Event size * average throughput combined with the expected latency help to compute buffer size.\n* Can the producer batch events together to send them in batch over one send operation?\n* Is there a risk for loosing communication? Tune the RETRIES_CONFIG and buffer size\n* Assess *once to exactly once* delivery requirement. Look at idempotent producer.\n\nSee [implementation considerations discussion](./producers/)\n\n### Consumers\n\nFrom the consumer point of view a set of items need to be addressed during design phase:\n\n* Do you need to group consumers for parallel consumption of events?\n* What is the processing done once the record is processed out of the topic? And how a record is supposed to be consumed?.\n* How to persist consumer committed position? (the last offset that has been stored securely)\n* Assess if offsets need to be persisted outside of Kafka?. From version 0.9 offset management is more efficient, and synchronous or asynchronous operations can be done from the consumer code. \n* Does record time sensitive, and it is possible that consumers fall behind, so when a consumer restarts he can bypass missed records?\n* Do the consumer needs to perform joins, aggregations between multiple partitions?\n\nSee [implementation considerations discussion](./consumers/)\n\nSee [also the compendium note](../compendium/) for more readings.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"0803aa4cc1b8dab7e05c91fa156e64e0","counter":256,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Apache Kafka","description":"Apache Kafka"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Apache Kafka\ndescription: Apache Kafka\n---\n\nIn this article we are summarizing what Apache [**Kafka**](https://Kafka.apache.org) is and are grouping some references and notes we gathered during our different implementations and  **Kafka** deployment within Kubernetes cluster.
