From the operator catalog search for MQ. See the [product documentation installation guide](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_9.2.0/com.ibm.mq.ctr.doc/ctr_installing_ui.htm) for up to date details.\n\nYou can verify your installation with the following CLI, and get the IBM catalogs accessible:\n\n```shell\noc project openshift-marketplace\noc get CatalogSource\nNAME                   DISPLAY                TYPE      PUBLISHER     AGE\ncertified-operators    Certified Operators    grpc      Red Hat       42d\ncommunity-operators    Community Operators    grpc      Red Hat       42d\nibm-operator-catalog   ibm-operator-catalog   grpc      IBM Content   39d\nopencloud-operators    IBMCS Operators        grpc      IBM           39d\nredhat-marketplace     Red Hat Marketplace    grpc      Red Hat       42d\nredhat-operators       Red Hat Operators      grpc      Red Hat       42d\n```\n\nOnce everything is set up, create an operator. The IBM MQ operator can be installed scoped to a single namespace or all namespaces.  \n \n <img src=\"./images/mq-operator.png\" width=\"200px\"></img>\n\nVerify your environment fits the deployment. [Prepare your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform for MQ](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_9.2.0/com.ibm.mq.ctr.doc/ctr_prepare_project_ui.htm)\nThen once the operator is installed (it could take up to a minute), go to the operator page and create a MQ Manager instance. For example be sure to have defined an ibm-entitlement-key in the project you are planning to use to deploy MQ manager\n\n <img src=\"./images/mq-mgr-via-operator.png\" width=\"200px\"></img>\n\nThen update the Yaml file for name, license and persistence.\n\n <img src=\"./images/mq-yaml.png\" width=\"200px\"></img>\n\nAs an alternate define a QueueManager manifest / yaml file.\n\n ```yaml\napiVersion: mq.ibm.com/v1beta1\nkind: QueueManager\nmetadata:\n  name: eda-mq-lab\nspec:\n  version: 9.2.0.0-r1\n  license:\n    accept: true\n    license: L-RJON-BN7PN3\n    use: NonProduction\n  web:\n    enabled: true\n  queueManager:\n    name: \"EDAQMGR1\"\n    storage:\n      queueManager:\n        type: ephemeral\n  template:\n    pod:\n      containers:\n       - name: qmgr\n         env:\n         - name: MQSNOAUT\n           value: \"yes\"\n ```\n\n Then create the QueueManager resource: \n\n ```shell\n oc apply -f mq-manager.yaml \n # Get the UI route \n oc describe queuemanager eda-mq-lab\n ```\n\n You should get the console from this URL: https://eda-mq-lab-ibm-mq-web-....containers.appdomain.cloud/ibmmq/console/#/\n \n ![4](./images/mq-console.png)\n\nTo access to the `mqsc` CLI and run configuration remote connect via `oc exec -it <podname> bash`.\n\n## Running MQ in docker\n\nThe [following recent article](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/mq-connect-app-queue-manager-containers/) from Richard J. Coppen presents such deployment, and can be summarized as:\n\n```shell\n# Use Docker to create a volume:\ndocker volume create qm1data\n# Start queue manager: QM1\ndocker run --env LICENSE=accept --env MQ_QMGR_NAME=QM1 --volume qm1data:/mnt/mqm --publish 1414:1414 --publish 9443:9443 --detach --env MQ_APP_PASSWORD=passw0rd ibmcom/mq:latest\n# The queue manager’s listener listens on port 1414 for incoming connections and port 9443 is used by MQ console\n```\n\nOne queue is created DEV.QUEUE.1 and a channel: DEV.APP.SRVCONN. \n\nThen `docker exec` on the docker container and use the `mqsc` CLI.\n\n## Getting access to the MQ manager\n\nThe MQ Console is a web browser based interface for interacting with MQ objects.
