Policies include a subject (user, service, access group), target (resource), and role. \n\t* Policy can be set to all resources in a resource group\n\t* There are two types of access _roles_: platform management and service access.\n\nHere is the main page for the IAM service on IBM Cloud where an account owner can manage the different components of the security control:\n\n![1](./images/iam-main-page.png)\n\n## Event Streams access management\n\nThis section is a quick overview of the [Managing access to your Event Streams resources](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/EventStreams?topic=eventstreams-security) article.\n\n### Roles\n\nUsers perform only specific tasks when they are assigned the different roles. The roles defined for Event Streams are Reader, writer and manager.\n\n* _Reader_ for an application, can only consume records\n* _Writer_ applications can produce and consumer records\n* _Manager_ access administration to the Event Streams instance.\n\n### Assign access\n\nThe type of Kafka resources that may be secured are *cluster, topic, group, or txnid*. Specifying a type is optional. \nIf you do not specify a type, the policy then applies to all resources in the service instance\n\n\n## Add access group to the account\n\nThe goal of this step is to create an access group to access Event Streams services as administrator.\n\n1. From the IBM Cloud main page, go to the Manage > IAM \n\n\t![2](./images/iam-access-1.png)\n\n\tThis should lead you to the main IAM page as illustrated in previous figure.\n\n1. Under the Access Group, we can create a new group:\n\n\t![3](./images/iam-new-ag.png)\n\n1. Then add users to the group, by selecting user from the available list, (those users were invited to join the account) and Click on `Add to group` link.\n\n\t![4](./images/iam-ag-add-user.png)\n\n1. Finally add Access Policies, click Assign access button:\n\n\t![5](./images/iam-es-ap-1.png)\n\n1. Then the type of resource (Event Streams) you want to define the access policy to include all instances of a service type.:\n\n\t![6](./images/iam-es-ap-2.png)\n\n1. Then specify the access role for the Event Streams service:\n\n\t![7](./images/iam-es-ap-3.png)\n\n1. Add the policy and assign it to the group. You could stay in the same panel to add more target to the policy.\n\n\t![8](./images/iam-es-ap-4.png)\n\n1. The access policies for administer / manage any Event Streams service is now listed in the access group:\n\n\t![9](./images/iam-es-ap-5.png)\n\nAny user who has a manager role for either 'All' services or 'All' Event Streams service instances' in the same account also has full access.\n\n## Limiting topic access to group of users\n\nThe product document illustrates some access control common scenarios in [this section](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/EventStreams?topic=eventstreams-security#security_scenarios). \nIn this step we are implementing one of the classical scenario: suppose we have a line of business that will create topics by applying a naming convention where topic name starts \nwith a prefix like: `bn-lob1-*`.  We want users and service ID to  get read / write access to only those topics matching those prefix.\nTo do that you need to:\n\n1. Add an access group to include member of the line of business: `bn-lob1-group`\n1. Define an access policy with the following criterias:\n\t* Event streams as resourc type\n\t* All regions\n\t* Specifying one of the Event Streams resource instance\n\t* Select the service instance that hosts the target cluster\n\t* Specify the resource type to be topic \n\t* And the resource ID to matches `bn-lob1-*`\n\n\t![T1](./images/iam-es-top-1.png)\n\n\t* Then add a second rule to do read access at the cluster level:\n\n\t![T2](./images/iam-es-top-2.png)\n\n\t* Accept the two rules\n\t\n\t![T3](./images/iam-es-top-3.png)\n\n\t* The group has the two access policies:\n\n\t![T4](./images/iam-es-top-4.png)\n\n\n## API Keys\n\nTo let an application to remotly authenticate itself, Event Streams uses APIkeys. \nSo now, we want to create an API key for other applications, tools, scripts to interact with our IBM Event Streams instance.\n\n1. In your IBM Event Streams instance service page, click on _Service credentials_ on the left hand side menu:\n\n\t![8](images/8.png)\n\n1. Observe, there is no service credentials yet and click on the _New credential_ button on the top right corner:\n\n\t![9](images/9.png)\n\n1. Enter a name for your service, choose _Manager_ role for now and click on _Add_:\n\n\t![10](images/10.png)\n\n1. You should now see your new service credential and be able to inspect its details if you click on its dropdown arrow on it left:\n\n\t![11](images/11.png)\n\n### Adding Keys with CLI\n\nWe could create the service credentials using the CLI, so we will add reader and write role API Keys:\n\n1. First we can explore the service credentials created previously, using the CLI with `$ ibmcloud resource service-key <service_credentials_name>`:\n\n\t```shell\n\t$ ibmcloud resource service-key demo-serv-cred\n\tRetrieving service key demo-serv-cred in all resource groups under account bill's Account as A......\n\n\tName:          demo-serv-cred\n\tID:            crn:v1:bluemix:public:messagehub:eu-de:a/b636d1d8.....8cfa:b05be932-2....02e687a:resource-key:4ba348d2-...-360e983d99c5\n\tCreated At:    Tue May 12 10:53:02 UTC 2020\n\tState:         active\n\tCredentials:\n\t\t\t\tapi_key:                  *****\n\t\t\t\tapikey:                   *****\n\t\t\t\tiam_apikey_description:   Auto-generated for key 4ba348d2-5fcf-4c13-a265-360e983d99c5\n\t\t\t\tiam_apikey_name:          demo-serv-cred\n\t\t\t\tiam_role_crn:             crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::serviceRole:Manager\n\t\t\t\tiam_serviceid_crn:        crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam-identity::a/b636d1d83e34d7ae7e904591ac248cfa::serviceid:ServiceId-380e866c-5914-4e01-85c4-d80bd1b8a899\n\t\t\t\tinstance_id:              b05be932-2a60-4315-951d-a6dd902e687a\n\t\t\t\tkafka_admin_url:          https://mh-tcqsppdpzlrkdmkbgmgl-4c201a12d7add7c99d2b22e361c6f175-0000.eu-de.containers.appdomain.cloud\n\t\t\t\tkafka_brokers_sasl:       [kafka-2.mh-tcqsppdpzlrkdmkbgmgl-4c201a12d7add7c99d2b22e361c6f175-0000.eu-de.containers.appdomain.cloud:9093 kafka-0.mh-tcqsppdpzlrkdmkbgmgl-4c201a12d7add7c99d2b22e361c6f175-0000.eu-de.containers.appdomain.cloud:9093 kafka-1.mh-tcqsppdpzlrkdmkbgmgl-4c201a12d7add7c99d2b22e361c6f175-0000.eu-de.containers.appdomain.cloud:9093]\n\t\t\t\tkafka_http_url:           https://mh-tcqsppdpzlrkdmkbgmgl-4c201a12d7add7c99d2b22e361c6f175-0000.eu-de.containers.appdomain.cloud\n\t\t\t\tpassword:                 *****\n\t\t\t\tuser:                     token\n\t```\n1.

Using the same approach add a `Writer` role named `bn-lob1-writer`: `ibmcloud resource service-key-create bn-lob1-writer Writer --instance-name \"Event Streams-wn\"`\n\n## Control applications access\n\nThe last step of this lab is to link any future applications to a group so that producer and consumer codes using the Writer role API key as defined previously\ncan read and write to specific topic as defined by a access policy.\n\nWe want to give this Writer role API key to the `bn-lob1` team, so they can only create topics and R/W on those topics with the name `bn-lob1-*`. \nTo do so, we have to add in the Access Group ``,  the service ID that maps the Key created above:\n\n1. In IAM Access groups select the service IDs tab and click on add service id button:\n\n\t![SI1](./images/iam-ag-serv-1.png)\n\n1. Search for the key name: `bn-lob1-writer` and  \n\n\t![SI2](./images/iam-ag-serv-2.png)\n\n1. You should get this result:\n\n\t![SI3](./images/iam-ag-serv-3.png)\n\n## Kafka Streams specifics\n\nA lot of Kafka implementations use Kafka Streams API, in this case the applications need to have `Manager` role on topic resource,\nand Reader role for cluster and group with a Manager API Key.

Add a `Reader` role API key:\n\n\t```shell\n\tibmcloud resource service-key-create bn-lob1-reader Reader --instance-name \"Event Streams-wn\"\n\n\tOK\n\tService key crn:v1:bluemix:public:messagehub:eu-de:a/b6...248cfa:b05...e687a:resource-key:7ee00.....15a2 was created.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\tName:          bn-lob1-reader   \n\tID:            crn:v1:bluemix:public:messagehub:eu-de:a/b636d..fa:b05b..7a:resource-key:7ee0042.....b15a2   \n\tCreated At:    Wed May 13 00:33:49 UTC 2020   \n\tState:         active   \n\tCredentials:                                   \n\t\t\t\tapi_key:                  xrvMI4PQYmdOcUwPRUJXy6Xlo9UCY9xywNUPiU3jjpKH      \n\t\t\t\tapikey:                   xrvMI4PQYmdOcUwPRUJXy6Xlo9UCY9xywNUPiU3jjpKH      \n\t\t\t\tiam_apikey_description:   Auto-generated for key 7ee0042f-572b-46f6-b9cc-912cc63b15a2      \n\t\t\t\tiam_apikey_name:          bn-lob1-reader      \n\t\t\t\tiam_role_crn:             crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::serviceRole:Reader      \n\t\t\t\tiam_serviceid_crn:        crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam-identity::a/b636d1....48cfa::serviceid:ServiceId-b4d3....18af1      \n\t\t\t\tinstance_id:              b05....687a      \n\t\t\t\tkafka_admin_url:          https://mh-tcqsppdpzlrkdmkbgmgl-4c201a...1c6f175-0000.eu-de.containers.appdomain.cloud      \n\t\t\t\tkafka_brokers_sasl:       [kafka-0.mh-tcqsppdpzlrkdmkbgmgl-4c2...175-0000.eu-de.containers.appdomain.cloud:9093....]      \n\t\t\t\tkafka_http_url:           https://mh-tcqsppdpzlrkdmkbgmgl-4c20...-0000.eu-de.containers.appdomain.cloud      \n\t\t\t\tpassword:                 xr......KH      \n\t\t\t\tuser:                     token      \n\t```\n1. Using the same approach add a `Writer` role named `bn-lob1-writer`: `ibmcloud resource service-key-create bn-lob1-writer Writer --instance-name \"Event Streams-wn\"`\n\n## Control applications access\n\nThe last step of this lab is to link any future applications to a group so that producer and consumer codes using the Writer role API key as defined previously\ncan read and write to specific topic as defined by a access policy.\n\nWe want to give this Writer role API key to the `bn-lob1` team, so they can only create topics and R/W on those topics with the name `bn-lob1-*`. \nTo do so, we have to add in the Access Group ``,  the service ID that maps the Key created above:\n\n1. In IAM Access groups select the service IDs tab and click on add service id button:\n\n\t![SI1](./images/iam-ag-serv-1.png)\n\n1. Search for the key name: `bn-lob1-writer` and  \n\n\t![SI2](./images/iam-ag-serv-2.png)\n\n1. You should get this result:\n\n\t![SI3](./images/iam-ag-serv-3.png)\n\n## Kafka Streams specifics\n\nA lot of Kafka implementations use Kafka Streams API, in this case the applications need to have `Manager` role on topic resource,\nand Reader role for cluster and group with a Manager API Key.
