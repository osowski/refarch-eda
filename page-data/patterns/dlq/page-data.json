The call may fail. So what should be the processing to be done to retry and gracefully fail by leveraging the power of topics and the concept of dead letter.\n\nThis pattern is influenced by the adoption of Kafka as event backbone and the offset management offered by Kafka. Once a message is read from a Kafka topic by a consumer the offset can be automatically committed so the consumer can poll the next batch of events, or in most the case manually committed, to support business logic to process those events.\n\nThe figure below demonstrates the problem to address: the `reefer management microservice` get order event to process by allocating a reefer container to the order. The call to update the container inventory fails.\n\n![Dead letter context](./images/dl-1.png)\n\nAt first glance, the approach is to commit the offset only when the three internal operations are succesful: write to reefer database (2), update the container inventory using legacy application service (3), and produce new event to `orders` (4) and `containers` (5) topics. Step (4) and (5) will not be done as no response from (3) happened.\n\nIn fact a better approach is to commit the read offset on the orders topic, and then starts the processing: the goal is to do not impact the input throughput. In case of step (2) or (3) fails the order data is published to an `order-retries` topic (4) with some added metadata like number of retries and timestamp.\n\n![Dead letter context](./images/dl-2.png)\n\nA new order retry service or function consumes the `order retry` events (5) and do a new call to the remote service using a delay according to the number of retries already done: this is to pace the calls to a service that has issue for longer time. If the call (6) fails this function creates a new event in the `order-retries` topic with a retry counter increased by one. If the number of retry reaches a certain threshold then the order is sent to `order-dead-letter` topic (7) for human to work on. A CLI could read from this dead letter topic to deal with the data, or retry automatically once we know the backend service works.
