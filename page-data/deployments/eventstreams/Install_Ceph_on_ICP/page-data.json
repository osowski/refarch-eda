Setup Ceph Cluster \n\n**Step #1** Update the [ceph-values.yaml](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-eda/blob/master/deployments/ceph/ceph-values.yaml) to match your environment.\n\nThe file *ceph-values.yaml* needs to be updated to list the IP address of the storage node within the IBM Cloud Private cluster. \n\n```\n...\n#\n# UPDATE VARIABLES TO MATCH THE ENVIRONMENT\n#   \n    nodes:\n    - name: \"X.X.X.X\"\n      devices:\n      - name: \"DISK_NAME\"\n    - name: \"Y.Y.Y.Y\"\n      devices:\n      - name: \"DISK_NAME\"\n    - name: \"Z.Z.Z.Z\"\n      devices:\n      - name: \"DISK_NAME\"\n...\n...\n```\n\n**Step #2** Modify and run the setup script to install Rook Operator chart and the IBM Rook RBD Cluster chart\n\nThe contents of the script [setup.sh](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-eda/blob/master/deployments/ceph/setup.sh) is as follows: \n\n```\n#\n# UPDATE VARIABLES TO MATCH THE ENVIRONMENT\n#\n\n# Define the location of images \nIMAGE_DIR=/DIRECTORY_HAVING_IMAGES\n\n...\n```\n\n!!! note\n    The script should be updated to include the correct location for *IMAGE_DIR* that has the location where the chart ibm-rook-rbd-cluster-0.8.3.tgz is downloaded and unzipped. \n\nThe output of Ceph install is listed below for reference: \n \n- [ceph_install.log](./samples/ceph_install.log)\n\n\n### 4. Verify Ceph cluster\n\nThe script [status.sh](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-eda/blob/master/deployments/ceph/status.sh) can be run to check if Ceph cluster is working as expected. \n\nThe contents of the script [status.sh](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-eda/blob/master/deployments/ceph/status.sh) is as follows: \n\n```\n./deployments/ceph/status.sh \n``` \n\nExpected output is listed below. \n\n![](./images/cephGetStatus.png)\n\n\n### 5. Troubleshooting Ceph setup\n\n#### 5.1 Steps for reseting an used disk \n\nIt is possible that sometimes OSD pods does't start up even though the OSD prepare jobs have completed successfully. \nIt could happen when the device you have specified does not have a raw disk and the device name you have listed was used for other storage like GlusterFS cluster.\n\nIn such case the following commands can be run to collect the Logical Volume group ID and Physical volume and remove it fully so that the raw disk is made available for the Ceph cluster.\n\n```\npvs\npvdisplay\nvgremove LOGIOCAL_VOLUME_GROUP_ID -y \npvremove PHYSICAL_VOLUME\n```\n\nThe output of the aforesaid commands is listed below.\n\n```\n[root@rsun-rhel-glusterfs03 ~]# pvs\n  PV         VG

for uninstalling the rook-ceph setup \n\n**Step #1** The script [cleanup.sh](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-eda/blob/master/deployments/ceph/cleanup.sh) can be run to remove the Ceph setup completely.\n\n```\n./deployments/ceph/cleanup.sh\n``` \n\n**Step #2** Remove the contents of the temporary directory used by rook: */var/lib/rook*\n\nThe following command should run on all the worker nodes: \n\n```\nrm -fr /var/lib/rook\n```\n\n#  Ceph Cluster Management\n\nThe following links has additional details on how to diagnose, troubleshoot, monitor and report Ceph cluster
