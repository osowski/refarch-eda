It is based on Kafka Connect framework, and it supports data and metadata replication, like the topic configuration, the offset and the consumer checkpoints are synchronously replicated to the target cluster.\n\nMirror maker uses the cluster name or identifier as prefix for topic, and uses the concept of source topic and target topic. The specification is described in detail in [this KIP 382](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-382%3A+MirrorMaker+2.0#KIP-382:MirrorMaker2.0-RemoteTopics,Partitions).\n\nTo test the tool, we can use the Strimzi Kafka latest docker image deployed on Openshift cluster (We address Strimzi deployment in [this note](../deployments/strimzi/deploy.md)). For mirror maker 2.0, the deployment descriptor are in the [Strimzi project](https://strimzi.io/downloads/) under the `examples/kafka-mirror-maker-2` folder (we have a copy of this yaml file, prepared for our replication, in the deployments/strimzi folder of this project).\n\nTo define the clusters and topic configuration we use a properties file. One simple example to replicate from IBM Cloud Event streams to Kafka on premise is in the folder [deployments/strimzi/es-mirror-maker.properties](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-eda/blob/master/deployments/strimzi/es-mirror-maker.properties)\n\nUsing the same kafka image we can start a mirror maker container with:\n\n```properties\nclusters = source, target\nsource.bootstrap.servers = my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap-jb-kafka-strimzi.gse-eda-demos-fa9ee67c9ab6a7791435450358e564cc-0001.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud:443\nsource.security.protocol=SSL\nsource.ssl.truststore.password=password\nsource.ssl.truststore.location=/home/truststore.jks\ntarget.bootstrap.servers = kafka1:9092\n# enable and configure individual replication flows\nsource->target.enabled = true\nsource->target.topics = test\n```\n\n```bash\n./connect-mirror-maker.sh /home/strimzi.properties \n```\nWhen Mirror maker starts it will create some topics on source cluster to manage the offsets and topic metadata:\n\n```\nmm2-configs.target.internal                                   1            3\nmm2-offset-syncs.target.internal                              1            3\nmm2-offsets.target.internal                                   25           3\nmm2-status.target.internal                                    5            3\n```\n\nAnd on the target cluster:\n\n```\n__consumer_offsets\nheartbeats\nmm2-configs.source.internal\nmm2-offsets.source.internal\nmm2-status.source.internal\nsource.checkpoints.internal\nsource.heartbeats\nsource.test\n```\n\nThe `source.test` topic is the replicated `test` topic from the source cluster.\n\n![](images/mm-k-connect.png)\n\n## Active - Passive\n\nTo support active - passive, one site has producers and consumers on local topics, and topic data are replicated on active cluster without online consumers\n\n\n## Active - Active\n\n* producers, deployed on IBM cloud within Openshift, send messages to Event streams on cloud, on the 'reeferTelemetries` topic.
