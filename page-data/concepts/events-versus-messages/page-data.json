You can easily see an event driven solution and events in the context of messaging systems and messages. However, there are different characteristics that are worth considering:\n\n* **Messaging:** Messages transport a payload and messages are persisted until consumed. Message consumers are typically directly targeted and related to the producer who cares that the message has been delivered and processed.\n* **Events:** Events are persisted as a replayable stream history. Event consumers are not tied to the producer. An event is a record of something that has happened and so can't be changed. (You can't change history.)\n\n![](./images/evt-msg.png)\n\n## Messaging versus event streaming\n\nWe recommend reading [this article](https://developer.ibm.com/messaging/2018/05/18/comparing-messaging-event-streaming-use-cases/) and [this one](https://developer.ibm.com/messaging/2019/02/05/comparing-messaging-pub-sub-and-event-streams/), to get insight between messaging (focusing on operations / actions to be performed by a system or service) versus event (focusing on the state / facts of a system with no knowledge of the downstream processing. To summarize messaging (like MQ) are to support:\n\n* Transient Data – data is only stored until a consumer has processed the message, or it expires\n* Request / reply most of the time\n* Targeted reliable delivery: targeted to the entity that will process the request or receive the response. Reliable with transaction support.\n\nFor events:\n\n* Stream history: consumers are interested by history and not just the most recent event\n* Scalable Consumption: A single event is consumed by many consumers with limited impact as the number of consumers grow.\n* Immutable Data.\n* Decoupling of Producers and consumers\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"4ce3cb5670c70f92dec1d91cd926459f","counter":316,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Events versus Messages","description":"Comparing and contrasting events and messages as communication artifacts in distributed systems."},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Events versus Messages\ndescription: Comparing and contrasting events and messages as communication artifacts in distributed systems.\n---\n\n<InlineNotification kind=\"warning\">Content currently under review - expand via work in cloudnative101.dev</InlineNotification>\n\n## Events and Messages\n\nThere is a long history of *messaging* in IT systems.
