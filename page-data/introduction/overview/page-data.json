It learns, predicts and is intelligent -- it is by nature Event-Driven.\n\nEvent-driven architecture (EDA) is an architecture pattern that promotes the production, detection, consumption of, and reaction to events. This architectural pattern can be applied to the systems that transmit events among loosely coupled software components and services.\n\nEvents are a way of capturing a statement of fact.  Events occur in a continuous stream as things happen in the real and digital worlds.  By taking advantage of this continuous stream, applications can not only react in real time, but also reason about the future based upon what has happened in the past.\n\nThe business value of adopting this architecture is that you can easily extend EDA with new components that are ready to produce or consume events that are already present in the overall system. While events are more visible, new business capabilities are addressed, like real time insights.
