An event consumer consumes events that are useful in achieving its goals and in doing so establishes what data it needs and the type and format of that data.

For example, an event notification in XML format must conform to a certain schema that must be known by both the consumer and the producer.

For the purposes of this EDA discussion, a module is defined as an independently deployable software unit that has high cohesion. Cohesion is strongly related to coupling in the sense that a highly cohesive module communicates less with other modules, thus reducing the number of events most importantly, the number of event types in the system. The less frequently modules interact with each other, the less coupled they are. Achieving cohesion in software while optimizing module size for flexibility and adaptability is difficult, but something to strive for. Designing for cohesion starts with a holistic understanding of the problem domain and good analysis work. Sometimes it must also take into account the constraints of the supporting software environment. Monolithic implementations and implementations that are excessively fine-grained must be avoided."))}l.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
