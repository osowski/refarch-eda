It learns, predicts and is intelligent — it is by nature Event-Driven.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Event-driven architecture (EDA) is an architecture pattern that promotes the production, detection, consumption of, and reaction to events. This architectural pattern can be applied to the systems that transmit events among loosely coupled software components and services.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Events are a way of capturing a statement of fact.  Events occur in a continuous stream as things happen in the real and digital worlds.  By taking advantage of this continuous stream, applications can not only react in real time, but also reason about the future based upon what has happened in the past.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The business value of adopting this architecture is that you can easily extend EDA with new components that are ready to produce or consume events that are already present in the overall system. While events are more visible, new business capabilities are addressed, like real time insights. EDA helps also to improve continuous availability of a microservice architecture.`}</p>\n    <p>{`For enterprise IT teams, embracing event-driven development is foundational to the next generation of digital business applications. IT teams will need to be able to design, develop, deploy and operate event-driven solutions, in cloud-native styles.`}</p>\n    <p>{`While event-driven architectures and reactive programming models are not new concepts, the move to cloud-native architectures with microservices, container based workloads and “server-less” computing allow us to revisit event-driven approaches in this cloud-native context.  Indeed, we could think of event-driven as extending the resilience, agility and scale characteristics of “cloud-native” to also be reactive and responsive.
